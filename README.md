##  Public Functions

### Admin Functions

- `initialize-contract(administrator-address)`
- `update-price-oracle-address(new-oracle)`
- `toggle-market-trading-status()`
- `register-new-commodity(commodity-id, quantity, price)`

### Escrow Management

- `deposit-funds-to-escrow(amount)`

---

## Usage Flow

1. **Initialization**
    - Deploy the contract and call `initialize-contract()` to set the admin/oracle.

2. **Commodity Setup**
    - Admin calls `register-new-commodity()` with details.

3. **Funding**
    - Traders call `deposit-funds-to-escrow()` to add STX to their trading balance.

4. **Trading**
    - Call `execute-trade()` with commodity ID, quantity, and a unique position ID.
    - Position details are stored and escrow balance is deducted.

5. **Closing Position**
    - Call `close-trading-position()` to calculate settlement and return STX to escrow.

6. **Withdrawal**
    - Call `withdraw-funds-from-escrow()` to retrieve unused escrow balance.

---

## Security Checks

- Role-based access for admin/oracle actions.
- Price and quantity validations to avoid invalid trade entries.
- Escrow balance checks prevent overdrafts.
- Trading cannot proceed if the market is disabled.

---

##  Development Notes

- Written in **Clarity**, the smart contract language for **Stacks**.
- `block-height` is used as a timestamp substitute for entry recording.
- Oracle logic can be extended to integrate with off-chain feeds.
- Future improvements: real-time P&L, price updates by oracle, automated liquidation, multi-token support.
